Ideas for optimizing later:

Beam Search:
-Modify algorithm to take more than one 'best option' upon reaching depth

Dynamic Search Depth:
-Adaptively choose decision tree depth
    -Look at initial board size (r and c) to determine a good starting value
    -Increase depth as board becomes more empty

Better Storage:
-Change how board is stored to be more efficient
-Bitmaps/Bitmasks?
